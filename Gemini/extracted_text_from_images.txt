Certain people have said that the world is like a
calm pond, and that anytime a person does even
the smallest thing, it is as if a stone has dropped
into the pond, spreading circles of ripples fur-
ther and further out, until the entire world has
been changed by one tiny action. If this is true,
then the book you are reading now 1s the per-
fect thing to drop into a pond. The ripples will
spread across the surface of the pond and the
world will change for the better, with one less
dreadful story for people to read and one more
secret hidden at the bottom of a pond, where
most people never think of looking. The miser-

able tale of the Baudelaire orphans will be safe

scheme after scheme to get his hands on the
enormous fortune the Baudelaire parents had
left behind, the market looked the same as the
day Justice Strauss, a kindly neighbor and a
judge in the High Court, had first taken them
there. Towering ovet the market was an enor-
mous, shiny building that Klaus recognized as
667 Dark Avenue, where the Baudelaires had
spent some time under the care of Jerome and
Esmé Squalor in an enormous penthouse apart-
ment. It seemed to the middle Baudelaire that
the building had not changed one bit since the
siblings had first discovered Esmé’s treacherous
and romantic attachment to Count Olaf. And
Sunny Baudelaire, who was still small enough
that her view out the window was somewhat
restricted, heard the rattle of a manhole covet!
as the taxi drove ove! it, and remembered the
underground passageway she and her siblings
had discovered, which led from the basement of
667 Dark Avenue to the ashen remains of their

own home. Like the market and the penthouse,

During intermission I followed them to the
snack bar and slipped them a box of poison darts
before Esmé Squalor could catch me. It was dif-
ficult, but as one of my comrades likes to say;
‘To be daunted by no difficulty; to keep heart
when all have lost it; to go through intrigue spot
less; to forgo even ambition when the end is
gained—who can say this is not ereatness? And
speaking of greatness, please hold on. We can’t

When someone says that their head is spin-
ning, they are usually using an expression which
means that they are very confused. Certainly
the Baudelaires had occasion to use the expres-
sion in this way, after listening to a person hur-
riedly summarizing the troubles of a splintered
secret organization and quoting various histori-
cal figures on the subject of wickedness while
driving a taxi hurriedly toward some mysteri-
ous, unexplained errands. But there are rare

As she boarded the elevator, the harpoon
gun heavy and sinister in her gloved hands, Vio-
let Baudelaire felt as if the clock were scolding
her for her efforts at solving the mysteries of
the Hotel Denouement. Wrong! She had tried
her best to be a flaneur, but hadn’t observed
enough to decode the scheme of Esmé Squalor
and Carmelita Spats. Wrong! She had tried to
communicate with one of the hotel’s managers,
but had been unable to discover whether he
was Frank or Ernest. And—most Wrong! of all—
she was now taking a deadly weapon to the
rooftop sunbathing salon, where it would serve
some unknown, sinister purpose. With each
strike of the clock, Violet felt wronger and
wronger, until at last she reached her destina-
tion, and stepped out of the elevator. She dearly
hoped her two siblings had found more success
in their errands, for as she walked across the
